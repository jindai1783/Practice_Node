# Practice Node

## Introduction

This repository is my attempt to practice Nodejs by answering the questions of [learnyounode]. Asynchronous function is one of the major conceptual leap from coding in Ruby, where all the functions are synchronous. The structure of a method is a bit more complex, therefore I have made a comment of the potential pitfalls of calling asynchronous function for future reference.
